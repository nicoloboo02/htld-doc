*(1) The manual will indicate what known errors there are. It will be appreciated if the pilot users take that into account and give feedback of the errors they encountered that are not yet known.

*(2) For the manual of the first version of the service, iTop was not yet fully configured.

*(3) Different versions of the service might require different time dedication. This will be taken into account in the evaluation of the pilot users.

*(4) For the request of feedback during the Sprint 2, it was assumed that the Pilot users would have access to the organization. However that was not the case and it was not possible to use iTop to report the issues encountered
